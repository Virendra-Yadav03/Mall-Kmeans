# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The dataset contains information about mall customers such as age, annual income, and spending score. By grouping similar customers together, businesses can better target marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Objective
- To segment customers into meaningful groups
- To understand customer spending behavior
- To assist in targeted marketing and business decision-making

## Dataset
The dataset typically includes:
- Customer ID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

## Methodology
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing
3. Feature selection (Annual Income & Spending Score)
4. Determining optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
5. Applying K-Means clustering
6. Visualizing customer segments

## Algorithm Used
- K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Machine Learning)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The model groups customers into distinct clusters representing different purchasing behaviors such as:
- High income, high spenders
- High income, low spenders
- Low income, high spenders
- Low income, low spenders

## Use Case
- Customer segmentation
- Targeted marketing campaigns
- Business strategy optimization

## Conclusion
K-Means clustering provides valuable insights into customer behavior, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies and improve overall performance.
